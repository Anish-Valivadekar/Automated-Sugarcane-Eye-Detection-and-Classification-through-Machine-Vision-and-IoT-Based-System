**Project Title:**

**Smart Sugarcane Eye Detection and Cutting System using Computer Vision and AI**



**Aim:**

To develop an intelligent system that automates the detection and cutting of sugarcane "eyes" using image processing and machine learning techniques for improving the efficiency of sugarcane cultivation.



**Problem Statement:**

In traditional farming, identifying sugarcane “eyes” (buds/nodes used for replanting) is done manually.
This process is:

* Time-consuming
* Labor-intensive
* Error-prone, especially over large volumes

The challenge is to **automate** this process using a camera-based vision system integrated with a **robotic cutting mechanism** that can detect and cut at precise positions in real time.



 **Proposed Solution:**

We propose a smart precision farming system that:

1. Uses **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** to detect sugarcane eyes in real-time images
2. Validates position using a **trained Machine Learning model**
3. Sends signal to a **robotic actuator or cutting blade** to perform the cut
4. Ensures precision and consistency in detecting viable eye regions for replanting
